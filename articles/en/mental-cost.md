Yesterday we discussed the concept of mental startup costs. Today, let's explore how to effectively reduce these costs to better achieve our goals.

As we enter 2025 and begin setting our New Year's resolutions, there's an important question to consider before setting your goals:

Have you fully understood all the steps involved in achieving this goal? Is it simply a matter of increasing effort, or is it something you haven't really explored yet?

For instance, some people easily set ambitious goals like reading 100 books in a year, despite rarely reading in their daily lives. Such goals are unlikely to be achieved. For goals we're already familiar with, we can directly set quantifiable targets and action plans, reducing uncertainty. If you're already a regular reader who completes one book per month, you might challenge yourself to read two books monthly, focusing on finding more efficient reading methods.

For unfamiliar goals, we need to break down tasks, gradually explore each component, and act in phases. Start with reading one book per month, or a few chapters per week, slowly building a reading habit. Don't try to accomplish everything at once â€“ the enormous mental startup burden will completely drain your motivation to act.

Here are some key strategies to reduce mental startup costs:

1. **Start Small**: Break down large goals into smaller, manageable tasks
2. **Build on Existing Habits**: Leverage what you're already doing well
3. **Gradual Progress**: Allow yourself time to learn and adapt
4. **Realistic Planning**: Set goals based on your current capabilities, not idealistic scenarios

Remember, sustainable progress comes from understanding and working with your mental startup costs, not fighting against them.
