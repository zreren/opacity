# 简介

GitKraken is a cross-platform Git Gui tool. Different from other Git Gui tools, GitKraken has an excellent interface and interaction design, which makes it very easy to switch branches, view files, and handle conflicts. However, it uses Electron for development, which takes up a lot of memory. It would be better if it can be developed with tarui. I also plan to use Tarui to develop a Git Gui tool in the future.
